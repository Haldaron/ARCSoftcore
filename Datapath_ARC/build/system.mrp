Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         3,712 out of   9,312   39%

Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          3,841 out of   4,656   82%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   3,841 out of   3,841 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   3,841   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,458 out of   9,312   47%
    Number used as logic:             4,403
    Number used as a route-thru:         23
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:      32
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 48 out of      66   72%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      13
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.23

Peak Memory Usage:  409 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  14 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   14 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator dapa/shift/bs/z<4>31 failed to merge
   with F5 multiplexer dapa/shift/bs/z<4>21_f5.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s500e' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network p1/uart_master/fifo_tx_unit/Mram_array_reg1/SPO
   has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 15 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   p1/uart_master/fifo_tx_unit/Mram_array_reg2/SPO,
   p1/uart_master/fifo_tx_unit/Mram_array_reg3/SPO,
   p1/uart_master/fifo_tx_unit/Mram_array_reg4/SPO,
   p1/uart_master/fifo_tx_unit/Mram_array_reg5/SPO,
   p1/uart_master/fifo_tx_unit/Mram_array_reg8/SPO
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal clk are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
